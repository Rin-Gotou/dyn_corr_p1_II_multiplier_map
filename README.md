# dyn_corr_p1_II_multiplier_map

This is the program files used for computations in my paper "Dynamical Systems of Correspondences on the Projective Line II: Degrees of Multiplier Maps".

multinv(1,3)computation2.sage: SAGE file
The program to compute invariant-theoretic interpolation algorithm.
This uses West's definitions of invariant basis of I(V4 o+ V2).

mult2(1,3)elim.sage:
The program to compute the relation among the second multiplier map and including their result as a comment. 
The computation is done by computing elimination ideal and finishes in few minutes in CoCalc.
